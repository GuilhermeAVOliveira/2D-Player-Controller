# 2D-Player-Controller
A player controller made for 2D characters in Unity. I tried making it modular with a script for basic movements to use as a "hub" and multiple scripts with differente movements to add. Using the new unity input system.</br>
For now the scripts are on their initial stage because I still want to add more features and am planning on creating combat mechanics.</br>
This is my first time posting a script on github so I will be very grateful for every advice given to me, be it for the code or just the post in general.
